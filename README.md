<p><strong>Securing Express Applications with HelmetJS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong>  
In this course, I delved into HelmetJS, a middleware tool designed for Express-based applications to enhance security by automatically setting various HTTP headers. These headers help safeguard against common vulnerabilities and prevent sensitive information from being exposed during server-client interactions. The course equipped me with the knowledge to protect web applications from various forms of malicious behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HelmetJS:</strong> Middleware for Express applications that sets HTTP headers to enhance security and prevent common vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features Implemented:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTTP Header Security:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Integrated HelmetJS into an Express application to automatically configure security-related HTTP headers.</li>
      <li>Configured headers to protect against common threats such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and clickjacking.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Customizing HelmetJS:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Customized specific HelmetJS settings to suit the application's security needs.</li>
      <li>Enabled or disabled particular security features based on application requirements.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Testing Security Enhancements:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Verified the effectiveness of HelmetJS by checking the HTTP headers in browser developer tools.</li>
      <li>Ensured that the applicationâ€™s security posture was strengthened against potential attacks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
